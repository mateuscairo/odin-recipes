        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>With all that good food, we need to have at least an equal good drink
            to combine with. That said, caipirinha was our choice. It's a very re
            freshing brazillian drink that is made with lemons, sugar and "cachaça".
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 limes per drink</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>Cachaça</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the limes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Slice off the end of each lime</li>
                <li>Cut the limes in half, lenghtwise. Stand the halved limes up
                    and slice lenghtwise in quarters
                </li>
                <li>Take each quarter, one at time, and hold it upright by the skin 
                    side. Then, slice down through the pith, removing and discarding it.
                </li>
                <li>Lay each pith-less quarter skin side down and cut the lime in
                    half, crosswise
                </li>
                <li>You should have 8 wedges per lime</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Muddle</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you don't have an ice machine that produces crushed ice, place 
                    your ice cubes in a resealable bag, and smash with a meat tenderizer 
                    or rolling pin until the ice is crushed.</li>
                <li>In a rocks glass, combine the lime wedges (try to place them flesh side up) 
                    and 1 to 2 tablespoons of sugar. Muddle just until the limes release their juices. 
                    Muddling too much will cause the caipirinha to be bitter! </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Mix!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the ice, then pour 6 to 8 ounces of cachaça. Serve with stirrers and let your guests stir their own drinks</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
