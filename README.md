# odin-recipes
Repo for the first project of The Odin's Project 

This project consists in create webpages, wich the first one is an index page containing a list of three food recipes of my own choice. This main page should display every recipe that has been chosen and be able to direct the user to those pages when clicking it.

Inside the recipes pages, we must present a photo of what the recipe looks like and add three main topics: Description, Ingredients(presented by an unordered list) and Steps (presente by an ordered list).

By doing this project, I was able to learn about several stuff in HTML, such as:
    -Filling out an usual boilerplat HTML;
    -Using tag for improve texts (<h1>,<h2>,<p>,etc.);
    -Images and links (using attributes of these tags) ;
    -Ordered and unordered lists (and lists inside lists).

Aside that, I could learn the basic usage of git and github. For this project I've done all the work flow of git, from creating the repo in github and cloning to my local, to making commits and push back to remote.
